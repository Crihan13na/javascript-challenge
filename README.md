# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

 We will use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 
* Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
